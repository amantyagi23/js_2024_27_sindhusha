Web is so popular
why js is so popular

json

language -> JSON ->  JavaScript object notation -> language of web 
all data -> travel in json form
json -> a object that is written like string 
"{key:value,key1:vaule,}"


frontend -> backend -> database




Array:-> array is a box []

let name = ['Aman','Tushar','akansha','Akhil','mayank']

at each pos.. there is a unique value known as index
this index start from 0 upto the length of array -1

Array is a basic data structure ->

Array advantages

retrive the value by using index value
all the data is stored in linear manar



Assignment operators
=     LHS=RHS 
+  to add two values , to concate
-
* multiply
/ divide
6/2 = 3
modules
7 % 3 = 1


2^3 = 8

pre 
++1 = 1

--1 = 1

post 
++
ex- 1++ = 2
--
ex - 1-- = 0

Logical

and  -> &&
OR  -> ||
compare -> ===,==
Not -> !=
greater and greater than -> > ,>=
less and lest than equal -> < , <=



variable making 
datatypes
let , var, const

condition render;

as if


10 > 7 -> true 
10 == '10' -> true
value check 
lose compare

10 === '10' -> false
value check And type check of data types 
strict compare


let x = 10;
let y = 12;
if(x >= y){
    console.log(x);
}
else{
    console.log(y)
}



if(condition){
}
else if(){
}
else{
}


Switch case


Looping

print 10 times name -> tushar 
DRY -> do not repeat yourself ->
console.log('Tushar')
for repeated task 


types of loops

for loop
variable making , condition , operator

syntax for loop


for(x = 0,x>9,x++){

}


var value x = 0,check the condition [ body will work] x = 1




while loop

do while loop


foreach loop

forof , forin
